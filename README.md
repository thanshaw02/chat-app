# Chat App

This is a small project to help me hone my TypeScript, React, Node, Express, and Socket.IO skills.

Once this is done you should be able to chat with other user's, save messages, send photos, videos, etc.

Originally I was going to use `Angular` instead of `React` but opted for react for now -- I may re-write the frontend in `Angular` sometime in the future howveer to practice using Angular.

# Note

I will be updating this README as the project progresses
